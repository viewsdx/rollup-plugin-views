# Views (viewsdx.com) language's rollup plugin

Include at the top of your `rollup.config.js`'s `plugins` list like:

```
import views from 'rollup-plugin-views'

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    views({
      root: './src' // optional, defaults to process.cwd(), tells the path prefix
                    // from which to load your views
    }),
    // in particular, include this plugin before any other like babel or buble
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
}
```

See https://github.com/viewsdx/test-rollup for a sample app using this plugin.

## Known limitations
If you add a new file, you'll have to modify an existing one for rollup to recognise it.
